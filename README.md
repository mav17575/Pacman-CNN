# Pacman-CNN
A little library to connect Pacman with a CNN.

Project has been dropped due to performance issues. OpenAI-Gym was used instead.
The latest state of this project was a fully working Library(with Convolution-, Maxpool- and DenseLayers, custom Activations and Losses).
Altough quite slow, it was atleast able to solve MNIST in a reasonable amount of time.
Latest state is probably not on this Repo.
